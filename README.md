# palmer_pedal
A 3d printed part to mount a palmer pedal on a pedal board using velcro whithout damaging the rubber pad

* The file is provided in openscad format
* I've printed it on a cheap anet A8, 20% infill (does-it really matter ?)
* just slide your palmer pedal in the mounting part
* stick your velcro strip on the mounting part
